# QR-Contacts

QR Contacts is a mobile app developed using the Ionic Framework with React + TypeScript. The backend is managed using Firebase. 

The app allows users to securely share contact information instantly using QR codes.

When Alice scans Bob's QR code, Bob's most up to date contact information is returned from Firebase and is updated on Alice's phone contacts. 

## What I've learned:
- Backend architecture using NoSql through Firebase.
- How to create strongly typed React components using TypeScript.
- React state management using React's Context API.
